Holographic-AI-Liana

Liana: Next-Generation Holographic AI Interface

Liana is a cutting-edge holographic AI interface (HoloNet v2.1) designed for intelligent conversations, deep concept analysis, and adaptive user interaction. Powered by œÄ-resonance networks and holographic memory, Liana combines advanced text processing with a modern, mobile-friendly UI. It also supports dynamic SVG-based visualizations using the W3C SVG namespace (http://www.w3.org/2000/svg).

‚∏ª

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	Interactive UI: Sleek, responsive chat interface with animations, dark mode, and context menus.
	‚Ä¢	Knowledge Agent: Searches and caches information from Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo, and a local knowledge base for fast, reliable responses.
	‚Ä¢	Holographic Memory: Retains conversation history and user interactions for context-aware replies.
	‚Ä¢	œÄ-Resonance Analysis: Multi-level processing of user input (depth 1‚Äì3) for tailored responses.
	‚Ä¢	SVG Integration: Generates dynamic visualizations using the W3C SVG namespace (W3C SVG Spec).
	‚Ä¢	Extensible Architecture: Ready for future GitHub agent integration and modular feature expansion.
